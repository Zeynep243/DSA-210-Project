# DSA-210-Project


## Project Goal
- I plan to study how a country's economy, education system, and governance influence the global reputation rankings of universities. I'll look at factors like GDP, school enrollment rates, education spending to find out whether university rankings are significantly influenced by a country's overall success.

## Motivation
- I was intrigued by how university rankings are done. That is why I want to analyze what factors could be affecting a country’s university rankings other than university's academic performance and possibly get some insight about Türkiye’s universities as well.

## Datasets
- Secondary school enrollment
- PISA scores: How well students perform on math, reading and science can inform about education quality.
- Educational attainment at least Bachelor's or equivalent: Measures the proportion individuals in the country with high education.
- Pupil-teacher ratio for tertiary: Reflects student access to faculty, affecting academic quality.
- Government expenditure per student for tertiary: Invesment made per student can affect quality of education they receive.
- Government expenditure on post-secondary education: More investment can yield better results.
- GDP (current USD and PPP): Affects national research funding and university budgets.
- GDP per capita (current USD and PPP): Measures wealth distribution and its impact on education.
- Total population of the country: Larger populations may have more universities, affecting ranking representation.
- High-technology exports (% of total exports): Shows technological advancement of the country.
- Political Stability Estimate: A stable environment attracts international students.
- Rule of Law Index: Shows institutional quality, governance, and academic freedom.
- Times Higher Education (THE) Reputation Ranking of Universities: Ranks universities according to their reputation based on the surveys.
