DSA 210 Project
## Project Goal
- I plan to study how a country's economy, education system, and governance affect the reputation of its universities. I'll look at factors like GDP, school enrollment rates, education spending to find out whether university rankings are influenced by a country's overall success.

## Motivation
- I was intrigued by how university rankings are done. That is why I want to analyze what factors could be affecting a country’s university rankings and maybe get some insight about Türkiye’s universities as well.

## Datasets
1. PISA Scores

## Tools and Methods
- Relevant Python, Pandas, Matplotlib features
- Statistical methods learned during the classes
